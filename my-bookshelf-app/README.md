# Object Identifier - AI-Powered Image Analysis

A React web application that allows users to upload images and identify objects using AI-powered analysis. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Easy image upload with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Image Preview**: Preview uploaded images before analysis
- **Mock AI Analysis**: Demo functionality with simulated AI object identification
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **PWA Ready**: Installable as a Progressive Web App
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-bookshelf-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` folder with optimized files ready for deployment.

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Static File Hosting
Upload the contents of the `build` folder to any static hosting service:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- AWS S3
- Azure Static Web Apps

#### Option 2: Local Server
Install and run a local server:
```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

#### Option 3: Docker (Optional)
Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root:
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t object-identifier .
docker run -p 80:80 object-identifier
```

### PWA Installation
Users can install this app on their devices:
- **Desktop**: Click the install button in the browser address bar
- **Mobile**: Use "Add to Home Screen" from the browser menu

## API Integration

The app supports both mock data (for demonstration) and real AI analysis with OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API.

### Quick Setup for Real AI Analysis

1. Get an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_DATA=false
   ```
3. Restart the development server: `npm start`

üìñ **For detailed setup instructions, see [API_SETUP.md](API_SETUP.md)**

### Configuration Status

The app includes a configuration panel (click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon) that shows:
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå API Key status
- Current mode (Mock Data vs Real AI Analysis)
- AI service being used

### Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- API keys in React apps are visible to users - implement server-side API for production use
- Consider rate limiting and usage monitoring for production deployments

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation!** 
Removes the single build dependency and copies configuration files.

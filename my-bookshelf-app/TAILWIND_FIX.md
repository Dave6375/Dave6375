# TailwindCSS PostCSS Plugin Fix

## Problem
The error occurred because TailwindCSS v4 moved the PostCSS plugin to a separate package `@tailwindcss/postcss`. The old direct usage of `tailwindcss` as a PostCSS plugin is no longer supported.

## Solution Terminal Commands

### 1. Install the required PostCSS plugin
```bash
cd my-bookshelf-app
npm install --save-dev @tailwindcss/postcss
```

### 2. Install and configure craco to override PostCSS configuration
```bash
npm install --save-dev @craco/craco
```

### 3. Update package.json scripts (done manually)
Changed from:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test"
}
```

To:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "craco start",
  "build": "craco build", 
  "test": "craco test"
}
```

### 4. Run the development server
```bash
npm start
```

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@craco/craco` dependencies, updated scripts
- `postcss.config.js` - Updated to use new PostCSS plugin format  
- `craco.config.js` - Created to override react-scripts PostCSS configuration

## Result
The TailwindCSS PostCSS plugin error is resolved and the development server runs successfully.
